Week1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), primary processing, and data visualization :

1. How does the data look?
2. Are there any duplicate entries? If yes, then what to do?
3. Are there any missing entries? If yes, then what to do?
4. Is the data inconsistent somewhere?
5. Have a look at these resources:

I am uploading my python notebook which I have made by basing on the Big Molecule Smiles dataset based on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yanmaksi/big-molecules-smiles-dataset.

Your assignment for the first week is to take any dataset on kaggle, (preferrably related to SMILES biut any text dataset will do) and submit a python notebook showing how you have answered the above four questions and completed preprocessing on the dataset. I would advise you to run the dataset by me before you use it so that you don't end up wasting your time. 

The deadline to submit is *Monday EOD*.

Feel free to ping me incase of any doubts.

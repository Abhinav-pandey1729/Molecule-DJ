Molecule DJ is a web app that converts chemical SMILES strings into individualized musical sequences. It has an audio output together with MIDI notes which are generated by an LSTM model from molecular features extracted from the molecule. 

🚀 How It Works 
> Extract molecular features using RDKit and SMILES.
> Trained LSTM model predicts note sequences.
> Converts notes to MIDI and renders audio with FluidSynth.
> Web app built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

How to run:
1. Train the model:
  > python3 Final-model.py
  > saves molecule_dj_model.keras

2. Ensure your SoundFont file is in the same folder and named:
   i.e. soundfont.sf2

3. Launch the app: 
  > streamlit run app.py

4. In the browser:
  > Enter a SMILES string
  > Click on Generate Music
  > Enjoy the generated audio!
